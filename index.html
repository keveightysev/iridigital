            <p>Howdy! Thank you for checking out my portfolio, and I appreciate your being curious enough to read more about me. </p>
            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="img/me2.jpg" alt="Photo of Kevin Smith">
                <p>My name is Kevin Smith. I love working with people, learning new things, and travelling. An ideal experience for me is combining all three of those things! I earned my Bachelor of Science in Business management from Western Governor's University in 2016. I started the Full Stack Web & Computer Science track at Lambda School in 2019.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="about-right">Where I'm From</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="img/EauClaire.jpg" alt="Photo of Eau Claire, WI" class="about-left">
                <p>I grew up and currently live in the small city of Eau Claire, WI, nested near the Northwoods. In 2011, I moved to Chicago and lived there for 5 1/2 years before moving to Virginia Beach in 2016.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I worked in customer service for over 10 years. As a "people person," I enjoyed working in that role as it allowed me to collaborate with many different business functions. To pivot into a role that involves building things, I started building web development skills in 2018.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I like to practice new skills or play video games.</p>
